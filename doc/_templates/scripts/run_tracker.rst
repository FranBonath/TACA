Run tracker
===========

This script is used to track finished runs on our processing servers and pre-process them.

After pre-processing, which basically is converting from BCL to FAST and demultiplexing,
the runs are sent to the analysis cluster. A simple CSV file is used to keep track
of the already transferred files.

The script uses the status files generated by both the sequencers and `bcl2fastq`
to know what is the status of the run and act accordingly.
